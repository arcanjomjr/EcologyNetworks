y <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlurgi/networks_for_r/master/datasets/anemonefish.txt")

#Transform the \n into new lines and the \t into spaces
anemonef <- read.table(text = y)

#Change the name of the columns from V1, V2, ..., V10 to A1, A2, ..., A10 
names(anemonef) <- paste("A", 1:10, sep = "")

#Change the name of columns from 1, 2, ..., 26 to F1, F2, ..., F26
#Now the anemones and the fishes are explicit in the table
row.names(anemonef) <- paste("F", 1:26, sep = "")       

#Convert it to a matrix
anemonef <- as.matrix(anemonef)

### The number of fish species in the network is the number of rows
n_fish <- dim(anemonef)[1]
### The number of anemone species is the number of columns
n_anemone <- dim(anemonef)[2]

### So, the total number of species is the sum of these two quantities
S <- n_fish + n_anemone

### Whereas the total number of interactions is still the sum of the matrix
L <- sum(anemonef)
